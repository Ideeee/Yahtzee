# Yahtzee
This program uses the principles of functional programming in Javascript to simulate the game of Yahtzee.

Yahtzee is a game that keeps track of the number of tries it takes to roll a group of dice till they all match the same number.

This code consists of two distinct functions, one that simulates rolling a group of dice and another function that keeps count of the tries.
